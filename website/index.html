<h1> 
Gesture-Based Presentation
</h1>

<div class = "description">
Until now, most presentations have been restricted by the linear, structured style of slideshow software. It often serves more as a distraction than a resource. It allows no freedom to deviate from a plan. In short, itâ€™s made most presentations super, super boring. We found that people are desperate for something different. Something that's interactive, fun, flexible, and easy to use. 
</div>
<div class = "description">
With a new simple, gesture-based system, we can create a presentation experience to match the personal style of any presenter. We can give them much more than just the power to  control a PowerPoint with gestures; we can fundamentally change the nature of presentating.
